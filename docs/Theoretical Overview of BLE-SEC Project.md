## Introduction to the Need for the Project

The rapid urbanization and increased pedestrian traffic in cities have led to a notable rise in crimes, especially mobile device theft. Improving urban security has become more urgent than ever. Imagine a system that, through the detection and anonymous tracking of Bluetooth devices, could identify suspicious behavior patterns. This would enable authorities to act proactively, potentially preventing crimes before they occur and creating a safer environment for everyone.

## Innovation in Urban Security

The BLE-SEC proposal combines two cutting-edge technologies:

1. **ESP32**: A low-cost, high-capacity device for detecting Bluetooth devices.
2. **LoRaWAN**: Enables long-range data transmission with minimal energy consumption.

This innovative system collects real-time data on people’s movements based on the devices they carry. The data is sent to a central server, where advanced algorithms analyze it to detect suspicious behaviors.

## Key Technical Aspects

The technical implementation is based on a network of ESP32 nodes strategically distributed across the city. Each node can detect Bluetooth signals from nearby devices. The collected information, including timestamp, signal strength, and approximate direction of the device, is transmitted via the LoRaWAN network to a central server. Advanced data analysis algorithms then process this data to identify anomalous patterns potentially indicating criminal activities.

### Key Technical Elements

1. **ESP32**: Detects Bluetooth devices.
2. **LoRaWAN**: Efficient long-distance data transmission.
3. **Data Analysis Algorithms**: Identifies suspicious behavior.
4. **Data Visualization Interface**: Tools for authorities to manage the collected information.

## LoRa and LoRaWAN

### What is LoRa?

LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology designed for IoT applications that require long-distance data transmission with low power consumption. It’s ideal for solutions needing broad coverage, such as monitoring sensors in cities or rural areas.

### LoRaWAN Overview:

LoRaWAN is the protocol used on top of LoRa technology. It defines how devices communicate within the network and ensures security, energy management, and efficient data transmission.

#### Infrastructure Components:

1. **Sensors or Nodes**:
    - Collect data and transmit it to gateways using LoRa.
2. **Gateways**:
    - Act as intermediaries, receiving data from nodes and forwarding it to network servers.
3. **Network Servers**:
    - Manage and process data received from gateways, ensuring secure communication.
